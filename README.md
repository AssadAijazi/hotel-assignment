# hotel-assignment

This project is an implementation of a question asked on the 2016 IB CS SL exam.

The program is a database program that will help a hotel keep track of all of its rooms and clients.

The files should be compiled and run in the following order:
1. MakeRoomFile.java
2. makeClientFile.java
3. HotelDriver.java
